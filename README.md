# GrubDash API Project

Bootcamp project: the back-end of a fictional food app, GrubDash. Demonstrates intermediate API capabilities of Node.js and Express.js while adhering to the design principles of representational state transfer (REST). Uses two datasets: Orders and Dishes.

Back-end users can view one order or all orders, create new orders, update and/or delete existing orders â€” same for dishes.
