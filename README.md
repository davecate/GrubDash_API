# GrubDash API Project

Bootcamp project: a mock-up of a food delivery app with a functioning API, allowing users to create orders by selecting dishes from a menu.
The project demonstrates intermediate API capabilities of Node.js and Express.js while adhering to the design principles of representational state transfer (REST).
